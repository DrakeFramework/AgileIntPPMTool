react is a js library that just makes it easy to quickly make ui

redux provides a way to store the application state like using a JWT token
redux can pass on token to the back end application by keeping state on the client side

first install node
then install the create-react-app script using git bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
create a new react app in the repo root (this takes a long time the first time)
$ create-react-app ppmtool-react-client
