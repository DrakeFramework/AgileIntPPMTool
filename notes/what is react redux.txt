react is a js library that just makes it easy to quickly make ui

redux provides a way to store the application state like using a JWT token
redux can pass on token to the back end application by keeping state on the client side

first install node
then install the create-react-app script using git bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
create a new react app in the repo root (this takes a long time the first time)
$ create-react-app ppmtool-react-client

leave node modules alone

public - index.html is the entry point for the application
the dif id root is where the react application will live
	<div id="root"></div>
	
src - index.js renders the main app to the main element index.html to #root

src - app.js is where we set up routes and logic for what will render to element 
	index.js tell index.html to render what is specified in app.js
	
package.json is like the pom.xml listing dependencies and scripts to run on start

run npm start from terminal in the client directory to run the react app (app.js)
C:\Users\dnelson\ideaProjects\PPMToolUdemyTutorial\ppmtool-react-client>npm start

saving the app.js file automatically causes a reload of the page.
