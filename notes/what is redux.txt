this project should provide basic use cases for redux (see flow diagram)

redux provides a way to store the application state like using a JWT token
redux can pass on token to the back end application by keeping state on the client side


I think basically it just allows to cache stuff clientside

check the flowDiagrams for visual representations of the most basic use cases

1. create api
2. create action
3. create reducer
4. add to store
5. get from store
6. back to 1

install a bunch of stuff for redux
	-	chrome Redux DevTools plugin
	- $ npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk
		- redux is the core redux package
		+ redux@4.0.4			(4.0.0)
		- react-redux just as it sounds ties react and redux together
		+ react-redux@7.1.1  	(5.0.7)
		- redux-thunk middleware that is used to dispatch reducer actions to the store
		+ redux-thunk@2.3.0		(2.3.0)
	- $ npm i axios
		- install axios 
		+ axios@0.19.0 			(0.18.0)
	
with everything installed wire up store with store.js

create "reducers" package in src

create "actions" package in src to hold the actions
	-this will have actions but also a type.js file for generic

use the axios here just to follow the tutorial even though i prefer jquery
